*********

This package aims to provide a simple audio/music player for Emacs.  It
should "just work," with little-to-no configuration, have intuitive
commands, and be easily extended and customized.  (Contrast to setting
up EMMS, or having to configure external players like MPD.)  A Transient
menu, under the command ‘listen’, is the primary entry point.

   The only external dependency is VLC, which is currently the only
player backend that is supported.  (Other backends may easily be added;
see library ‘listen-vlc’ for example.)  Track metadata is read using
EMMS’s native Elisp metadata library, which has been imported into this
package.

   Queues are provided as the means to play consecutive tracks, and they
are shown in a ‘vtable’-based view buffer.  They are persisted between
sessions using the ‘persist’ library, and they may be bookmarked.

   The primary interface to one’s music library is through the
filesystem, by selecting a file to play, or by adding files and
directories to a queue.  Although MPD is not required, support is
provided for finding files from a local MPD server’s library using MPD’s
metadata searching.

   A simple "library" view is provided that shows a list of files
organized into a hierarchy by genre, date, artist, album, etc.  (This
will be made more configurable and useful in the future.)

   Note a silly limitation: a track may be present in a queue only once
(but who would want to have a track more than once in a playlist).

1 Installation
**************

Until it’s added to a repository, the easiest way to install this
package is with this Elisp code (removing the line that’s inappropriate
for your Emacs version):

     (use-package listen
       ;; For Emacs 29:
       :init (unless (package-installed-p 'listen)
               (package-vc-install '(listen :url "https://github.com/alphapapa/listen.el.git")))
       ;; For Emacs 30+:
       :vc (:url "https://github.com/alphapapa/listen.el"))

   You also need to have VLC installed.

2 Configuration
***************

Listen is intended to work with little-to-no configuration.  You can set
the ‘listen-directory’ to the location of your music library if it’s not
at ‘~/Music’.  See ‘M-x customize-group RET listen RET’.

3 Usage
*******

Use the command ‘listen’ to show the Transient menu.  From there, it
is–hopefully–self-explanatory.  Please feel free to give feedback if it
doesn’t seem so.
